# Stock Market Kafka Real Time Data Engineering Project

## Introduction 
I will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.

Apache Kafka is a real-time data streaming technology capable of handling trillions of events per day. Initially conceived as a messaging queue, Kafka is based on an abstraction of a distributed commit log. Since being created and open sourced in 2011, Kafka has since become the industry standard for working with data in motion.


We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.
